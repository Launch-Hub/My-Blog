# List Topics

Here’s a list of **high-value, interesting, and relevant topics** that a Senior React Developer like you could share—whether on a blog, tech talk, internal knowledge session, or LinkedIn post. These span advanced patterns, performance, architecture, and modern tooling. ✅

### ⚛️ **Advanced React Patterns & Architecture**

1. **React Architecture for Scalable Applications**
   How to structure folders, modules, state, and shared components for growth.

2. **Compound Components vs. Render Props vs. Hooks**
   Trade-offs and use-cases for building reusable and flexible components.

3. **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components: When and Why**

4. **React Server Components (RSC) and the Future of SSR**
   Especially relevant with Next.js 14 and app directory.

### 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

5. **Optimizing React Renders with `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`**
   Real-world examples, not just theory.

6. **React Lazy Loading Strategies**
   Lazy components, routes, images – using React.lazy and dynamic imports.

7. **Concurrent Rendering and `useTransition`**
   How it improves UX and avoids blocking renders.

8. **Avoiding Re-renders with Context API and Selectors**
   Recoil-like selectors with `useContext`.

9. **End-to-End Type-Safe Full Stack Apps with React + tRPC + Next.js + Prisma**

10. **Vite vs. CRA vs. Next.js: What's Right for Your Project?**
    Cold starts, HMR performance, SSR capabilities, etc.

11. **Monorepo Setup with Nx or Turborepo for React Projects**

### 🧩 **Design Systems / UI Layer**

18. **Design Systems in React: Build vs. Buy (e.g., MUI vs. Tailwind + Headless UI)**

19. **Theme Switching in React: System Preferences, Dark Mode, etc.**

---

### 🛰️ **Data & State Management**

20. **Zustand vs. Redux Toolkit: Minimalist State Management in 2025**

21. **Caching and Deduping with SWR, React Query, and Apollo**

22. **Forms in React: React Hook Form vs. Formik vs. HTML Native**

---
